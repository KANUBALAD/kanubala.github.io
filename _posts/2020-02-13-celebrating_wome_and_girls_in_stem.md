The International Day of Women and Girls in Science is celebrated annually on the 11th of February, 2020. This initiative was a result of a resolution from the United Nations General Assembly in December 2015. On this day, the world recognizes the role women and girls play in Science and Technology. Each years’ celebration is marked by a particular theme and this years’ theme was dubbed; “Investment in Women and Girls in Science for Inclusive Green Growth”. African Institute for Mathematical Sciences, Ghana as a Pan African Center of Excellence took a keen interest in this day and celebrated it with the rest of the world by organizing a very interesting program.

Find a snippet of the program lineup.


AIMS Ghana students created an anthem for our institution and we began the day’s celebration with a performance from the students. If you want to hear it, please ensure to visit the AIMS Ghana page via this link. Please don’t forget to like the page as well : )

The program continued with a talk from @Angela Tabiri, a postdoctoral fellow from AIMS Ghana. She is the Team Lead and Founder of femaafricmaths . Her talk centered on the challenges African women in science encounter. Dr. Tabiri used her own life experiences to illustrate the real challenges women face in Africa. Among other challenges, Dr. Tabiri mentioned the inability to aspire and inadequate female mentors. She encouraged girls and women alike not to be afraid to dream. Additionally, she explained how her mentors have helped her come this far and how important it is for everyone to have a mentor. Dr. Tabiri also shared with the students, scholarships that are available to women from developing countries including OWSD and the Schlumberger Faculty of Future scholarships.
