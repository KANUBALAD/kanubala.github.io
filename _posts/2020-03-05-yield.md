This project was a blend of a leadership and career development and an advocacy and science communication project. It was thus a one-day miniature Heidelberg Laureate Forum organized at the Radach conference center in Tamale in the Northern Region of Ghana. In line with the theme of the project, the activities of the conference included career development to provide career guidance for high school students, mentorship, exhibition of science projects and speeches from distinguished scientists. All these were aimed at encouraging high school students to pursue STEM related courses while igniting and sustaining their interest in Mathematics and Science in general. In addition to the guest speaker, Alhaji Mohammed Haroon, who is a former Northern Regional Director of Education, other speakers at the event included Dr. Mary Pedavoah, a Biochemistry lecturer at the University for Development Studies and Dr. Kwara Nantomah who is head of the Mathematics Department at the University for Development Studies. Other mentors comprising of a civil engineer and the project coordinator for Northern Sector Action on Awareness Centre (NORSAAC), a civil society organization in Ghana also graced the occasion. Dr. Kwara spoke on the practical application of STEM and pathways to increasing researchers in the field. His talk was followed by that of Dr. Mary Magdalene whose talk centered on the obstacles in pursuing a STEM career and the relevant attitude to succeed in them. The final speaker, Ms. Dorcas Attubea who delivered a talk on career opportunities in STEM. 

During the mentorship and career guidance phase of the conference, both students and experts alike had an opportunity to interact, where the students got an excellent opportunity to ask the experts questions and the experts shared their tips on how they managed to succeed in the field. The experts also shared their experiences and motivated the students on taking careers in Mathematics and Sciences. The students on the other hand had a comfortable atmosphere to ask questions on better ways to study and apply mathematics and science. One key side event during the conference was a scientific exhibition where some of the students from different high schools got to show the entire group of participants amazing projects they worked on. Among the exhibitions displayed included semi-automatic poultry incubator and a smart bin.

The conference was very successful and was attended by 80 students from 8 senior high schools in the Northern Region of Ghana and their teachers and was well covered by national electronic and print media houses. The success and euphoria around this conference underlines and illustrates the desire for STEM in the region despite the many challenges in the area. In the interest of the advancement of STEM, it is thus imperative that this interest be harnessed and nurtured with similar projects in the future. 

The organizers are grateful to AlumNode for their generous financial support in financing this project and American Mathematical Society(AMS) specifically, Prof. Catherine Roberts who supplied us with STEM related leaflets to distribute to the students.

# Introduction

If you've been writing some python code, you will definitely find yourself in need to writing functions to solve a task.

For example if I write the following code

```python 
def function_1(x : int) :
    for i in range(10+1):
        print(f'{x}*{i} = {x*i}')
    return 
```

It's not difficult to understand the behavior of this function.

But what it let look at a slightly modified version of the above function 

```python 
def function_2(x : int) :
    for i in range(10+1):
        yield(f'{x}*{i} = {x*i}')
```
It may not be obvious for you to understand the role of the keyword **yield** in function_2. 

In function_1 our function is taking an integer, and produce a table of multiplication, from 0 to 10, by the given number. 

```bash
5*0 = 0
5*1 = 5
5*2 = 10
5*3 = 15
5*4 = 20
5*5 = 25
5*6 = 30
5*7 = 35
5*8 = 40
5*9 = 45
5*10 = 50
```

In contrast the function_2 use a very special keyword **yield** that suspends the function’s execution and sends a value back to the caller, but retains enough state to enable function to resume where it is left off. When resumed, the function continues execution immediately after the last yield run. This allows its code to produce a series of values over time, rather than computing them at once and sending them back (return).

# Some fact about the yield keyword

The yield statement is only used when defining a generator function, and is only used in the body of the generator function. Using a yield statement in a function definition is sufficient to cause that definition to create a generator function instead of a normal function.

When a generator function is called, it returns an iterator known as a generator iterator, or more commonly, a generator. The body of the generator function is executed by calling the generator's next() method repeatedly until it raises an exception.

When a yield statement is executed, the state of the generator is frozen and the value of expression_list is returned to next()'s caller. By ``frozen'' we mean that all local state is retained, including the current bindings of local variables, the instruction pointer, and the internal evaluation stack: enough information is saved so that the next time next() is invoked, the function can proceed exactly as if the yield statement were just another external call.

The yield statement is not allowed in the try clause of a try ... 


The picture below shows an output of the **function_2**

# Advantages and Disadvantages of yield
Let conclude this short post by discussing some advantages and disadvantage of using the keyword **yield** in your program. 

## Advantages of yield:
- Since it stores the local variable states, the overhead of memory allocation is controlled.
- Since the old state is retained, flow doesn’t start from the beginning.

## Disadvantages of yield:

- May became difficult to debug, when used without appropriate comments.
