### About Me
I am a lecturer in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence at the [Academic City University, Accra Ghana](https://acity.edu.gh/) and I hold a BSc degree in Financial Mathematics and an Masters degree in Mathematical Science with a specialization in Big Data and Financial Mathematics. I am currently part of the prestigious [Africa Masters in Intelligence](www.aimsammi.org) sponsored by Google and Facebook. I am the co-founder of [Women Promoting Science to the younger Generation(WPSYG)](https://www.linkedin.com/in/women-promoting-science-to-the-younger-association-661a5317b/)  and hail from the Northern part of Ghana
which happens to be a region that remains underprivileged when it comes to women in STEM and ICT in Ghana. However, I have risen above the odds to gain a master’s in mathematics and have been engaged in several activities that seeks to promote more women in STEM.  Due to my active participation and promotion of women in STEM, I was voted among the  20 Most influential people in Northern Ghana, STEM Category. Additionally, I am a co-organizer of [Women in Machine Learning and Data Science](http://wimlds.org/about-the-accra-team/) Accra chapter. I have also been a recipient of several awards and grants including the Mastercard Foundation scholars grant, Alumnode grant from Germany and MIT Prize, and google awards during Indaba in Kenya and Indabax Ghana respectively. I envision a future where people will be assessed based on their skill set rather than their gender.
